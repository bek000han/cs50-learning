Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: real time increased with number of simulations

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: The results seemed to stabilise after 10000 simulations
